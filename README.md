#implementation of the salary prediction

y = m1x1 + m2x2 + m3x3 + b

m1,m2,m3 are coefficients

x1,x2,x3 are features

b is intercept

y = 2714.80376249*12 + 2297.04284387*10 + 1787.08647124*10 + 17782.522509408373

salary = m1 * Experience + m2 * test_scores(out of 10) + m3 * interview_score(out of 10) + b

y = m1x1 + m2x2 + m3x3 + b

y is dependent variable

m1,m2,m3 are coefficients

x1,x2,x3 are features(independent variables)

b is intercept
